# Document Querying with Retrieval-Augmented Generation using LLMs

## Project Overview

This project develops an advanced document querying platform utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs). It is designed to streamline the retrieval of information from extensive document sets, significantly improving query response times and accuracy through the use of state-of-the-art language models.

### Key Features

- **Document Upload:** Users can upload documents which are then processed and indexed, making them searchable through natural language queries.
- **Advanced Query Processing:** Utilizes LLMs to understand and process complex queries, returning accurate and relevant information from the document corpus.
- **Interactive User Interface:** A clean and responsive web interface built with React.js allows for easy navigation and operation by end-users.

### Technology Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI for handling API requests, integrated with the LangChain framework to leverage LLMs for document querying.
- **Frontend:** React.js, providing a dynamic user interface for uploading documents and submitting queries.
- **Language Models:** Uses LangChain's integration of various LLMs to enhance querying capabilities.
